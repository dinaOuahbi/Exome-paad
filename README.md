# Exome-paad
Differential comparison between good and bad prognosis in pancreatic cancer, according to the classification of a deep learning model

### Data preprocessing 

Patients without exome data: model8(n=25).

Intersection of exome data (n=152) with our patients: model8(n=141).

Removal of single-modality variables: 'disease', 'subtype'.

Checking for missing values: overlapping missing data, we can therefore separate our dataset into 3 subparts.
